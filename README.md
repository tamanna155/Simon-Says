This project is a simulation of the classic memory game [Simon Says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWJ5uYwQJGU), built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game tests and trains the player's memory by requiring them to replicate an increasingly complex sequence of lights and sounds.

## Technologies Used

HTML: Defines the structure of the game interface.
CSS: Styles the buttons, layout, and animations.
JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including sequence generation, user input handling, and scoring.

## How to Play

1. Start the Game:
Click the Start button to begin.

2. Observe the Sequence:
Watch the highlighted buttons in the sequence and listen to their corresponding sounds.

3. Repeat the Sequence:
Click the buttons in the exact order as shown.

4. Progress:
If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game advances to the next level with a longer sequence.
A mistake ends the game, and your score is displayed.
